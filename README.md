Are you spending valuable time on work a well-trained monkey could do? If so, _Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts_ will teach you how to automate repetitive tasks using Ruby, one of the most powerful and easy-to-use programming languages around.

_Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts_ provides 58 scripts that offer quick solutions to problems like system administration, manipulating images, and managing a website. After getting your feet wet creating simple scripts to automate tasks like file compression and decompression, you’ll learn how to create powerful web crawlers, security scripts, and full-fledged libraries and applications, as well as how to:

* Rename files, disable processes, change permissions, and modify users
* Manipulate strings, encrypt files, and sort efficiently
* Validate web links, check for orphan files, and generate forms
* Mass edit photos, extract image information, and create thumbnails
* Parse CSV files and scrape links, images, and pages from the Web

Andas a nod to our security friends, you’ll even learn how to use Ruby to write Metasploit exploits.
For each script you get the code, a discussion of how it works, and tips on how to customize it to solve real-world problems. By the time you’re finished, we think you’ll agree that Ruby is a wicked cool way to get things done.
